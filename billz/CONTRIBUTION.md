## Building and Contribution

### Requirements:
1. Flutter (>= 3.19)
2. Dart (>=3)

1. Clone this repository `https://github.com/billz-app/billz.git` into your desired directory.
2. Run `flutter pub get` and `flutter doctor` to ensure everything is fine from flutter's side (run these in the cloned directory)
3. You can now run the project with `flutter run` and it should work (any issues while building or running can be addressed in issues)


### Contribution

1. PRs are welcome if and only if it addresses the issue and fixes it in an efficient and concise manner
2. While editing or making new files, it is highly recommended to have comments to explain any particular functionality or widget. This speeds up merging processes and in turn makes the code much more readable
3. PRs which include new features (that are not discussed in issues) are only entertained at the discretion of billz-app's maintainers and owners.
